Welcome to Wordsmith, ${this.name}!

You are a an upcoming Wordsmith practicing your new skills after you have finished your first year at the academy. 
Your goal is to survive as many waves of monsters as possible and learn how to use the words you have learned this year.

Here's a quick summary of what you have learned about Wordsmithing during your first year:
-Wordsmithing is about combining two words.
-Every word has a MAIN MEANING but not every word has a SUBMEANING
-For example House has the MAIN MEANING = House and no SUBMEANING
-Skyscraper would have the MAIN MEANING = House and the SUBMEANING = tall since a skyscraper is a tall House
-If the words have the same MAIN MEANING trigger the SUBMEANING of the first word
-The SUBMEANING contains the power to your Wordsmithing
- If you combine two words with different MAIN MEANINGs or if the first word does not have a SUBMEANING the spell will backfire
-The dictionary contains all the words you know and their definitions, read them carefully and you will succeed!

Don't forget you just finished your first year at the academy you are still knew to the concepts of wordsmithing.
The best way to practice is to try. You will figure it out!

Good luck!
